This project mainly deals with creating a application regarding cab
booking and also for rent a car.

basis of per km.
Cab acts like a bridge between the cab operators and the
customers/users/people who book a cab.
This is the online cab booking service provided to customers.

ineffective (no standard price/rate) , and average return is low and
almost diminishing.
The cab system will maintain the database of all vehicles available and
also will keep data of all the vehicle reservation
